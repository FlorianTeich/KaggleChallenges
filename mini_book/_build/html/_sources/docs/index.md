# KaggleChallenges

## What is this repo about?
This repository will assemble all my developed approaches to several Kaggle Challenges.
Additionally, I will utilize some more advanced soft-skill to increase the comfort of this repo.
Namely: styling via black, documentation via sphinx and jupyter-book as well as reproducability and CI of scripts via docker.
