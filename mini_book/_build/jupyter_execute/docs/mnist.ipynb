    "## Overview\n",
    "The MNIST Challenge is quite popular as it is relatively small in size, high accuracy is easily reachable for newcomers and its (debatably) a Computer Vision dataset.\n",
    "We have a train split of handwritten digits, as grayscale images that are all cropped to 28x28 pixels, fully annotated with their correct object class: 0-9.\n",
    "Based on the training data, a model has to be created that correctly predicts the class of novel samples.\n",
    "As mentioned its debated whether this dataset is indeed Computer Vision as approaches that do not make use of 2d image features will still provide high classification accuracies.\n",
    "My first approach is a k-Nearest Neighbour classifier as these are easy to debug, i.e. its very easy to understand on what basis a classification decision was made.\n",
    "This stands in stark contrast to the CNN approach, which is still considered a blackbox method.\n",
    "More and more works emerge trying to add (human-understandable) explainablilty to CNNs but these are omitted here.\n",
